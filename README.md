# Summary

A repository of small-medium frontend projects to study & re-create for practice using semantic html & css best practices and tricks. I've created this repository to work in tandem with a new study group I've started in my local community. I'm trying to make it as self-explanatory as possible so others that simply view the repo from elsewhere will still be able to gain value from it.

* You will need a SCSS Compiler. Consider using [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) as it works on windows, linux and mac
* You will need Git installed on your computer. If you prefer the command line consider using [this](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you prefer a GUI (Graphical User Interface) then [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great option.

### Steps to Use

1. Fork the repo to your github account.
2. Clone the repo to your local computer, it doesn't matter where so choose your favorite spot.
3. Simply open the index.html in the repo root to navigate through the repo and activities.
    * Brackets Users: You can open the repo in the editor and click the live preview button
    * Alternatively if you have an existing apache environment setup, create a new vhost pointing to the repo root
4. When you want to start an activity, create a new branch on your forked repository with `git checkout -B {activity#}/{yourgithubusername}` (i.e. `git checkout -B activity1/im-ironclad`).
5. Once you've created the new branch, duplicate the starter-files directory in your desired activity and rename it to your github username (i.e. im-ironclad).
6. If you want your completed work to be seen by others on the original repo, push your work to your forked repo and create a PR (Pull Request) to the original repo.
